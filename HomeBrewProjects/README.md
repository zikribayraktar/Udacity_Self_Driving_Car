[**Project 1 - Setting up Google Cloud Platform Virtual Environment**](./Project_01/README.md) 
<br>
The goals of this project are:
* Google Cloud Platform offers attractive features and good pricing, where I am aiming to duplicate the work I do on my PC as well run the deep learning projects instead of AWS.
* Explore and exploit any useful cloud applications and tools for self driving car projects.
* Install and run two virtual machines, one cpu-only vm, and one gpu vm.

[**Project 2 - Setting up a Raspberry Pi with a camera in my car for SDC**](./Project_02/README.md)
<br>
The goals of this project are:
* Raspberry Pi (RP) is a low cost computer suitable for various homebrew projects. I aim to install all required software and the camera so that I can test the codes I write for the SDC nanodegree in real-time.
* Explore other ideas with the RP and the computer vision.
