[**Project 1 - Setting up Google Cloud Platform Virtual Environment**](./Project_01/_README.md) 

The goals of this project are:
* Google Cloud Platform offers attractive features and good pricing, where I am aiming to duplicate the work I do on my PC as well run the deep learning projects instead of AWS.
* Explore and exploit any useful cloud applications and tools for self driving car projects.
