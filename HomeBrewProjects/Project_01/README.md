## Setting up Google Cloud Platform Virtual Environment

The goals of this project are:
* Google Cloud Platform offers attractive features and good pricing, where I am aiming to duplicate the work I do on my PC as well run the deep learning projects instead of AWS.
* Explore and exploit any useful cloud applications and tools for self driving car projects.
* Install and run two virtual machines, one cpu-only vm, and one gpu vm.

account so that Google can give you $300 credit and a year to spend it on GCP.

Yout GCP platform console should look like this:
